        <hr>
        <p>Computers have been used in schools from the 1980s and, from learning vocational skills to efficiency of research, it has been improving student performance since.</p>
        <p>Students who use technology to study are more likely to attend school and perform better than one who don’t. As well as receiving higher grades in assessments. Computers also help students collaborate with others from miles apart by using conferencing applications such as Zoom or Teams with ease. This conferencing technology also helps students with disabilities as they can feel more involved in classwork with their fellow students.</p>
        <p>Before computers were integrated in technology students would sometimes need multiple heavy textbooks each day, which for some students is not possible for reasons such as long-distance walking to school, and if they didn’t want to carry it then it impacts their learning as they would not be able to study as efficiently. This is no longer a problem as most textbooks are now readily available to access online, this means students only need access to a desktop computer, laptop or now, even just a phone.</p>
        <p>If students use technology every day for their learning, they often gain skills which can be used in business later in life. Not necessarily in jobs which involve technology, in any kind of job which uses word processing, spreadsheets or presentations.</p>
        <p>Technology in the last few decades has been used heavily for research. Before, students would have had to rely on libraries having specific books having access to a library itself. Now they can just look through a plethora of academic texts of any size from around the world in their home, which are often easier to find information from, as there are indexing and search tools made for that purpose.</p>
