    <h2>Digitalising patient records</h2>
    <p>The digitalisation of patient records has had benefits for both patients and doctors. [2]Patients have benefitted from an increase in access to their records which allows them to be more involved in their healthcare which also helps to reduce the workload of GP practices by reducing the number of queries they have to process by allowing patients to view some information themselves. [1] Digital records also make it easier for doctors to find information on patients, which improves the treatment they can provide.[1] Digital records also reduce the amount of paper files that every practice has which reduces the storage space required and makes patient records easier to manage.</p>
